    "## Abstract\n",
    "We explore Knuth’s Algorithm X using a toroidal Dancing-Links (DLX) implementation to solve two canonical exact-cover problems: the N-Queens puzzle and Sudoku. First, we show how to build the exact-cover matrix for N-Queens, then run a DLX solver to count solutions for N = 5. Next, we convert a partially filled Sudoku into its exact-cover form, solve it with DLX, and present the completed grid."
