    "Eddy: DLX is a recursive depth-first backtracking algorithm that makes use of *circular doubly linked lists* to solve quasi-exact-cover problems. In an exact cover problem, columns represent constraints, and rows represent options. DLX reduces the exact cover problem by deterministically picking a column, \"covering\" it, and proceeding to remove all conflicting partial solutions (rows that also contain a node in the covered column). This algorithm then recurses upon this specific partial solution (covering the first column) until a solution is found (columns are all covered) or there are no more nodes in the target column."
